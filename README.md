Link to Assn: https://github.com/AnjulaMehto/Sampling_Assignment  
Input dataset: Creditcard_data.csv  

Steps:  
  ~Importing required libraries  
  ~Loading the data and separating features & target  
  ~Balancing dataset using SMOTE technique and then splitting it into train and test sets  
  ~Defining the models and sampling techniques to be used  
  ~Implementing sampling and fitting the models to each sample  
  ~Getting accuracies and displaying the results    

Output accuracies:
